*Curious, hungry, relentlessly optimistic.*

I'm an AI engineer passionate about enabling commercialisation of new innovations to market. I have experience in tech, design, and product management. 

And then, when not buried in streams of semi-conscious code, I take photos and make things. Past projects include a scooter that collapses into a bag, a rolling alarm clock/email assistant, a multi-tier expandable bag, and an automatic marshmallow roaster. Always keen on new ideas - let's chat!
