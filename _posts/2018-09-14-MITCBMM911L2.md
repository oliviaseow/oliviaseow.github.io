## 9.11 The Human Brain
Nancy Kanwisher, MIT

**2.1 The Face Recognition Problem**
1. What is the nature of face perception - inputs, outputs, challenges?
2. What is the nature of face representation - do they differ in any important way from representation of nonface stimuli?
3. Is face perception a distinct system from the rest of vision/cognition?
4. Do separate components exist within the face system? Like what?
5. What computations are conducted?

**Alphabet soup of ways to monitor brain activity**
PET, fMRI, ERP, MEG, ECOG, fNIRs

- Your face recognition system is set up to process the *whole* upright face at once
- The perfect control stimulus for the face is the inverted face
