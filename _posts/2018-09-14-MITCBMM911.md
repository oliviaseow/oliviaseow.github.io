## 9.11 The Human Brain
Nancy Kanwisher, MIT

**1.1 Why should we care about the brain?**
1. This is where the mind lives. It is the physical implementation of the mind and is who we are. We want to know - *what is this physical brain that is me?*
2. The brain has physical struce, different parts do different things

**1.2 How can we study the brain? Marr's levels of analysis**
*The nature of the computations that underlie perception depends more upon the computational problems that have to be solved than upon the particular hardware in which their solutions are implemented* -Marr, 1982
1. Computational theory (IO)
2. Algorithm / representation (code)
3. Hardware implementation

**1.2 Philosophical questions**
1. What is *special* about the human brain?
2. Where does knowledge come from - how much is genetic vs experience?
3. Can we think without language?
4. Can we perceive/understand/think/decide without awareness?
